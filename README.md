# Pervasive-Laboratory-Internship
In this repository you will find configurations useful to control many devices (such as Raspberry PIs) and robots (such as the Turtlebot 4)ng the Stack4Things infrastructure. 
Here you'll find guides in other to configure the devices in optimal manner along with some examples either to test the connection between the device and S4T or to get some inspiration to create something else.
